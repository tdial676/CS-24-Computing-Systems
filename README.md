# CS-24-Introduction-to-Computing-Systems
Course on computer systems, including hardware-software interface, computer architecture, and operating systems. Course emphasizes computer system abstractions and the hardware and software techniques necessary to support them, including virtualization (e.g., memory, processing, communication), dynamic resource management, and common-case optimization, isolation, and naming.
# Project Overview 
- # Disk:
  - Constructed a directory tree and recovered a file from a deleted USB Drive in C.
- # Java Virtual Machine
  - examined exactly how compiled Java classes are executed by the JVM by writing our own JVM in C.
- # Bomb
  - Defused virtual Bombs by reading the compiled assembly code and utilizing GDB alongside other debugging tools in C.
- # C Compiler
  - Wrote a a small C compiler that compiled C code into assembly and ran it.
- # Exploit
  - Utilized a heap buffer overflow exploit to hack and overwrite a website in C and x86-64.
- # Malloc
  - Wrote two malloc and free implementation from scratch (implicit and explicit). The first used an implicit list and the second used an explicit linked list to keep track of freed memory.
- # Virtual Memory
  - implemented complete and correct memory isolation for WeensyOS processes. Then I implement full virtual memory to improve utilization. 
- # Meltdown
  - Implemented the Meltdown attack using my knowledge of the kernel, caches, and virtual memory.
- # Concurrent programming 
  - Wrote a concurrent data structure(Queue and Thread Pools) and recovered passwords from their hashes in a parallel program. Utilized google virtual machine as we needed a CPU with multiple cores in C.
